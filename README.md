A little proof of concept for open-recognition repos HYF students accumulate over their stay with us and beyond

Besides a proof of competence, this repository can be a proof of progress as students move their constructive-criticism issues along the skill boards.  The skill boards will also help the students structure their study time before and after HYF.

This will also help centralize all coach feedback over the modules into an actionable format for the students.
